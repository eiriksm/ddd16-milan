# Internet of things?
> The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data.

        ### Other ways to do Drupal and IoT

        - Install Drupal on a Raspberry Pi
        - Attach some wires
        - Enable Php module
        - create a node with PHP filter that reads $_GET

          # 1st demo

          ## Offline status checker (esp8266 and LED)

          [Video demo](video/offline-online.mp4)
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          # What happens here?

          - Not a very smart "thing".
          - One-way communication (Drupal site does not know what requests it)
          - Only checks the status code (200 or not).
          - Turns on LED based on status code.
          - Not very Drupal specific.
          - Uses no authentication (no secret data is used, status code is "public")
        </section>

          # 2nd demo

          ## Toggle maintenance mode with a TV remote.

          [Video demo](video/remote-offline.mp4)
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          # What happens here?

          - Microcontroller receives IR signal.
          - Makes a request to a Drupal site, that has a path exposed to toggle maintenance mode.
          - Request uses session cookie to authenticate.
          - Kind of "headless" interaction with the Drupal site (we will expand on this later).
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          # Pros and cons about session authentication.

        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Pros

          - Easy to set up.
          - Uses the same permission system as the regular front-end.

        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Cons

          - Not persistent (time based).
          - Follows the browser session (if you log out of the browser, the "thing" will be logged out).
          - If session gets compromised, all permissons with that user gets available to attacker. You don't compromise an endpoint, but a user.

          # 3rd demo

          ## Headless and decoupled "thing" counting nodes.
          [Video demo](video/count-nodes.mp4)
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
        # What happens here?

        - Drupal saves a node, publishes a key in Redis.
        - Counter is communicating with a node.js server that listens for a key in Redis.
        - Upon change, query the "rest-version" of the front page and count number of nodes.
        - Rest query is as anonymous user, so it reflects the state of the frontpage (published/promoted).

          # 4th demo

          ## Raspberry Pi monitoring temperatures and posting them as nodes.
          [Video demo](video/post-temp.mp4)
        </section>
<section data-markdown>
# What happens here?

- Raspberry Pi senses temperature.
- Every 3 minutes (and on start) it sends the temperature to an endpoint using an API key.
- API keys are per user. If they are valid, a node is posted.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  # Pros and cons about API keys.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Pros

  - If key is compromised, the key only gives access to one specific thing (not the whole permission system and thus the user).
  - Keys can be regenerated system-wide and per user.
  - Keys can be persistent and with no relation to user sessions.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Cons

  - Still can be sniffed over plain HTTP.

# 5th demo

## Arduino node analysis, post TV remote off signal when a picture of a dog appears.
[Video demo](video/node-dog-offline.mp4)
</section>
<section data-markdown data-background="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEduLSwuxfMoTbMQg/giphy.gif" class="black">
  # What happens here?

  - Arduino superspeed processor does a GIF frame by frame analysis and recognises a dog in the GIF. Sends a NUKE LAZER command that reaches all the way to London (where the server is) and melts down the server farm of Linode.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  - ^^ (Just kidding).
  - Same decoupled node.js backend receives the node title as a key, find the word "dog" in it.
  - When "dog" is found, an IR signal is sent out (corresponding to a certain TV on/off toggle button)
  - Ardiuno does not care what receives the signal, so it is picked up and the toggle maintenance mode is sent.
  - The offline LED monitor picks up the offline mode of the site.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
# Some thoughts on dependencies on devices, services and Drupal in general
</section>
<section data-markdown>
- The Drupal site does not care who listens to a key, it just publishes something to redis.
- The node.js backend does not care where the redis publish came from. It just relays information.
- The Arduino does not care if the data it receives comes from Drupal or the node.js backend. Nor does it care if the IR signal is sent to a TV.
- The Tessel does not care about if the signal comes from a remote. Nor does it care if the toggle request is for a Drupal site.
- The Drupal site does not care about the origin of the toggle request, it only cares about authentication.
- The status monitoring does not care about anything at all.

# 6th demo

## Voice recognition, post a node based on this, with a picture, via the REST module.
[Video demo](video/voice-recognition.mp4)
</section>
<section data-markdown data-background="https://media.giphy.com/media/tyttpHduQdg3d6O8jAs/giphy.gif">
# What happens here?
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  - A "thing" is recording and upon silence is doing voice analysis of last recording.
  - If the word "cat" or "dog" is found, a node posting starts:
  - POST a new file entity via REST module (REST endpoint for file)
  - POST a new node entity via REST module, and attach the newly created file (REST endpoint for node).
  - The node has a title based on keyword (for example "a picture of a dog".
  - If the word "dog" is in the title, the IR signal for TV on/off is sent.
  - If the IR signal for TV ond/off is sent, request is sent for maintenance mode toggle on/off.
  - If maintenance mode is enabled, status checker goes red.

<section data-markdown>
# Autentication via REST module

- Uses the Basic auth module in core.
- Does not "interfere" with regular user sessions.
- Will (in theory) only provide access to REST resources if compromised.
- (although since this is basic auth you are basically giving away your password as well)
- Super important (still) with https.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  # Take aways?

  - Always, *always* use https.
  - Different strategies for autentication and security
  - Different patterns for communicating.
  - Drupal 8 is awesome.
  - Use https.
  - Eirik is not very good at soldering.
  - This upcoming gif
